                <!-- for the 50/50 I made a function and made it an onclick to work, 
                for the Phone and Audience it was a little more complex so I didn't use an onclick in HTML, I used an onclick in JavaScript then had more things happen afterwards
                like using the setTimeout feature to make the gif disappear and then have the friend image pop up afterwards. I really wanted to add sound effects to this project,
                namely like a call sound while the phone ringing gif was playing or an audience whispering before the audience answer appeared on screen but I don't think I could
                have done that in the amount of time we were given to complete this project. This was the last project I worked on and I believe I pulled out all the stops on
                this one, I spent the most amount of time between getting everything to function and look pretty on this project as I did just getting everything to function
                on the grocery list manager. I really enjoyed this project and wish we had more time because I could have made it a lot better in my opinion. -->
